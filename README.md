# Tableau-Challenge
Module 18 challenge 

## Overview

For this Module 18 Challegne I chose to look at citibike Data from 2019 and 2020 in June. 
The CSV files I pulled from are to large to put here however I can upload my Tableau public final product. 

## Analysis

The 2 phenomena I chose to look at were: 
1. Comparison of Station usage from 2019 to 2020 before and during covid.
2. Comparison of Average tripduration by Station from 2019 to 2020 before and during coivd
